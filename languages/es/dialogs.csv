dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Buenos dias, {chaval/niña}.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|Forgive me, you look like a trader, but I see none of your merchandise.
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|A trader? Oh, aye, I certainly am that. My merchandise is a bit different from most, however. It has to be fed and watered twice a day and tries to run away if I turn my back.
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|Livestock?
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Close enough. I like to call myself the man who keeps every ship in space moving. Ships are flown by engines, you see, and engines need men to run them or they stop. That's where I come in.
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|Slaves.
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Now you're catching on! A trading planet like this couldn't survive without them. The ships lose a few hands on every voyage, so there's always a high demand. The captains come to me and they pay well.
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|Where do the slaves come from?
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly I deal in convicted criminals bought from the authorities. Others are prisoners of war from various factions, brought to me because I offer the best prices. However, on occasion I'll buy from privateers and other . . . 'individuals'. You can't be picky about your suppliers in this line of work. You wouldn't happen to have any prisoners with you, would you?
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Me? 
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Why not? If you intend to travel outside this planet, you're going to get into a shoot-out with someone sooner or later. And, God willing, you'll come out on top. Why not make some extra money off the whole thing? Take them alive, bring them back to me, and I'll pay you fifty credits for each head. Don't much care who they are or where they come from.
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm. I'll think about it.
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Do think about it! There's a lot of credits to be made, no mistake. More than enough for the both of us.
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hello, {playername}.
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Anything else?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I've brought you some prisoners, Ramun. Would you like a look?
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|A pleasure doing business with you.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|How do I take somebody as prisoner?
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing.1|Can you tell me again about capturing prisoners?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|You're new to this, aren't you? Let me explain it in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a club, or shooting them with a stun blaster rather than cutting him open with a lightsaber, or blowing his head off. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? I'm assuming you have a blunt weapon or stun blaster with you . . .
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|As a matter of fact, I don't.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all you need to do is beat the bugger down with your weapon, or shoot him with it, and when the fighting's over you clap him in irons. It's a bit different for officers and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp. I don't have many requirements in my merchandise, but I do insist they be breathing when I buy them.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be your lucky day. I've got an old club lying around that I was going to throw away. It a bit battered, but still good enough bash someone until he stops moving. Here, have it.
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, Ramun. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Alright, I'll try and expain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a club, or shooting him with a stun blaster rather than cutting him open with a lightsaber, or blowing his head off. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for officers and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|Alright, I think I understand. Anything else?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Well, it's not as simple as all that. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as a lightsaber or a vibro-weapon, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly. And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a vibro-weapon. Moreover, having to drag prisoners to and fro will slow down your party, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting's done. It's madness. How could anyone turn down all those credits, eh?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|Is that everything?
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|Just one final thing. Managing prisoners safely is not an easy thing to do, you could call it a skill in itself. If you want to capture a lot of prisoners, you should try and learn the tricks of it yourself, or you won't be able to hang on to a single man you catch.
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I'd better be going.
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners you've got, bring them to me. I'll pay you good credits for every one.
dlga_start:manhunter_talk_b|Hey, you there! You seen any smugglers around here?
dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b1|Yes, they went this way about an hour ago.
dlga_manhunter_talk_b1:close_window|I knew it! Come on, lads, lets go get these bastards! Thanks a lot, friend.
dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b2|No, haven't seen any outlaws lately.
dlga_manhunter_talk_b2:close_window|Bah. They're holed up in this sector like rats, but we'll smoke them out yet. Sooner or later.

dlga_independent_trader_intro_1:independent_trader_intro_1|We are a convoy of Independent Traders alligned with the Trade Federation. We mostly trade in prisoners and robots and travel around the galaxy to pick up merchandise to transport to our home base.
dlga_independent_trader_intro_1:independent_trader_intro_2|Can you tell me more about the Trade Federation?
dlga_independent_trader_intro_2:independent_trader_1|Of course. The Trade Federation is an alliance of independent traders and companies who wish to remain neutral, so they will trade with any faction. We have several bases around the galaxy with shipyards, slave markets and a banking system that will allow you to keep your credits safe.

dlga_pretender_start:pretender_discuss_rebellion_1|I want to take up your cause and help you reclaim your throne!
dlga_pretender_start:pretender_end|I must leave now.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_1:pretender_discuss_rebellion_2|Are you sure you will be up to the task, {playername}? Reclaiming my throne will be no simple matter. The lords of our realm have all sworn oaths of homage to {s11}. Such oaths to a usurper are of course invalid, and we can expect some of the lords to side with us, but it will be a very tough and challenging struggle ahead.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_2:pretender_discuss_rebellion_3|I am ready for this struggle.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_2:pretender_end|You are right. Perhaps, I should think about this some more.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window|I have no doubt that your support for my cause is heartfelt, {playername}, and I am grateful to you for it. But I don't think we have much of a chance of success. If you can gain renown in the battlefield and make a name for yourself as a great commander, then our friends would not hesitate to join our cause, and our enemies would be wary to take up arms against us. When that time comes, I will come with you gladly. But until that time, it will be wiser not to openly challange the usurper, {s11}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.1|Haven't you already taken up the cause of {s17}? You must have a very strong sense of justice, indeed. But no, thanks. I will not be part of your game.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window.2|{playername}, you are already oath-bound to serve {s15}. As such, I cannot allow you to take up my cause, and let my enemies claim that I am but a mere puppet of {s16}. No, if I am to have the throne of {s17}, I must do it due to the righteousness of my cause and the support of my subjects alone. If you want to help me, you must first free yourself of your oath to {s15}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:pretender_rebellion_ready|You are a capable warrior, {playername}, and I am sure with your renown as a commander, and my righteous cause, the nobles and the good people of {s12} will flock to our support. The time is ripe for us to act! I will come with you, and together, we will topple the usurper {s11} and take the throne from his bloodied hands. But first, you must give me your oath of homage and accept me as your liege {reg65?lady:lord}.
dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion:pretender_town_quest|[Before we rebel, I want you to raise support for my cause. I have always had strong backing from the planet of {s4}, but you may have good ties in other places. Are you up for that?]

dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_renounce:lord_pretalk|Glad news, {playername}. I would fear for your safety otherwise. If you do encounter {s6}, be on your guard and don't believe a word.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_defend|{s6} is an honourable person, you've no right to speak of them that way.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_defend:lord_pretalk|As you like, {playername}. A fool you might be, but a loyal fool at the least. {s6}'s loyalty may not be so steadfast, however...
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend:lord_event_choose_friend_neutral|I don't want to be involved in your quarrel with {s6}.
dlga_lord_event_choose_friend_neutral:lord_pretalk|Hmph. As you wish, {playername}. Just remember that a {man/woman} needs friends in this world, and you'll never make any if you never stand with anyone.
dlga_start:lord_invite_1|{playername}, I've been expecting you. Word has reached my ears of your exploits. Why, I keep hearing such tales of prowess and bravery that my mind was quickly made up. I knew that I had found someone worthy of becoming my vassal.
dlga_lord_invite_1:lord_invite_2|Thank you, {s65}, you honour me with your offer.
dlga_lord_invite_1:lord_invite_2.1|It is good to have my true value recognised.
dlga_lord_invite_2:lord_invite_3|Aye. Let us dispense with the formalities, {playername}; are you ready to swear homage to me?

dlga_lord_invite_3:lord_enter_service_reject|No, {s65}. I cannot serve you right now.

dlga_start:lord_start.3|Well, {playername}...
dlga_lord_start:lord_start|{s42}
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed|Your surgeon managed to convince my friend and made the operation.  The matter is in God's hands now,, and all we can do is pray for his recovery. Anyway, I thank you for lending your surgeon to me {sir/madam}. You have a noble spirit. I will not forget it.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.1|Hah! Our little plot against {s3} worked perfectly, {playername}. The fool has lost one of their most valuable retainers, and we are one step closer to bringing them to their knees. Here, this purse contains {reg5} credits, and I wish you to have it. You deserve every copper. And, need I remind you, there could be much more to come if you've a mind to earn it...
dlga_lord_start:close_window|You werent't able to complete a simple task. I had set up everything. The only thing you needed to do was sacrifice a messenger, and we would be celebrating now. But no, you were too damned honorable, weren't you?
dlga_lord_start:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed|Have you brought me any news about that task I gave you? You know the one I mean...
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2|I have the reports you wanted right here.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_completed_2:lord_pretalk|Ahh, well done. It's good to have competent {men/people} on my side. Here is the payment I promised you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk|Brilliant work, {playername}! Your caravan raids really got their attention, I must say. I've just received word that {s13} has declared war! Now the time has come for us to reap the benefits of our hard work, {playername}. And by that I of course mean taking and plundering {s13} land! This war is going to make us rich {men/souls}, mark my words!
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.1|You incompetent buffoon! What in Hell made you think that getting yourself captured while trying to start a war was a good idea? These plans took months to prepare, and now everything's been ruined! I will not forget this, {playername}. Oh, be assured that I will not.
dlga_lord_start:lord_collect_debt_completed|I'm told that you've collected the money owed me from {s7}. Good, it's past time I had it back. I believe I promised to give you one-fifth of it all, eh? Well, that makes {reg3} credits, so if you give me my share -- that's {reg4} credits -- you can keep the rest.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_pay|Of course, {s65}. {reg4} credits, all here.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_pay:lord_pretalk|I must admit I'm impressed, {playername}. I had lost hope of ever getting this money back. Please accept my sincere thanks.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_completed:lord_collect_debt_no_pay|I am afraid I don't have the money with me sir.
dlga_lord_collect_debt_no_pay:close_window|Is this a joke? I know full well that {s7} gave you the money, and I want every denar owed to me, {sir/madam}. As far as I'm concerned, I hold you personally in my debt until I see that silver.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.1|I heard you got rid of that poxy merchant that was causing me so much grief. I can see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I like that in a {man/woman}. Here's your reward. Remember, {playername}, stick with me and we'll go a long, long way together.
dlga_lord_start:close_window.2|Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant? Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Just leave me be, {playername}, I have things to do.
dlga_lord_start:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go|You! Do you have sawdust between your ears? Did you think that when I said to kill the merchant, I meant you to have a nice chat with him and then let him go?! What possessed you?
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go:lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2|I made sure he will not act against you.
dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle. You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He had better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that. I have little use for {men/people} who cannot follow orders.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You captured both the spy and his handler, just as I'd hoped, and the pair are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned. My torturer shall be busy tonight! Anyway, I'm very pleased with your success, {playername}, and I give you this purse as a token of my appreciation.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {playername} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy will not dare return here and will prove quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you half the promised reward for what is but half a success.
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_half_completed:lord_pretalk|I did my best, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}.
dlga_lord_follow_spy_failed:lord_pretalk|Hrm. As you like, {s65}.
dlga_lord_start:lord_generic_mission_completed.2|Damn me, but you've done it, {playername}. All the serfs are back and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments.
dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I have been waiting patiently for my serfs, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation? Were you outwitted by simple fieldhands, or are you merely incompetent? Or perhaps you are plotting with my enemies, intending to ruin me...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a|Forgive me, {s65}, those serfs were slippery as eels.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b|Perhaps if you had treated them better...
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you reveal your true colours, traitor! Your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were 3 groups of serfs that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deal_with_bandits_completed|{playername}, I was told that you have crushed the bandits at the planet of {s5}. Please know that I am most grateful to you for that. Please, let me pay the expenses of your campaign. Here, I hope these {reg14} credits will be adequate.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.1|Glad to be of service.
dlga_lord_deal_with_bandits_completed:lord_pretalk.2|It was mere child's play.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pretalk.2|Damn it, {playername}. I heard that you were unable to drive off the bandits from the planet of {s5}, and thanks to you, part of the planet now lies in ruins. Everyone said that you were a capable warrior, but appearently, they were wrong.
dlga_lord_start:lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank|Ah, {playername}. My quartermaster has informed me of your delivery, a herd of {reg13} nerfs, as I requested. I'm impressed.
dlga_lord_deliver_cattle_to_army_thank:lord_pretalk|Not a problem, {s65}.

dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing I couldn't handle.
dlga_lord_scout_waypoints_thank:lord_pretalk.2|My pleasure, sir.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army|The army's supplies are dwindling too quickly, {playername}. I need you to bring me a herd of {reg3} nerfs so I can keep the troops fed. I care very little about where you get them, just bring them to me as soon as you can.

dlga_lord_mission_told_deliver_cattle_to_army_rejected:close_window|That . . . is unfortunate, {playername}. I shall have to find someone else who's up to the task. Please go now, I've work to do.

dlga_lord_report_to_army_continue:close_window|Then you'd better hurry. We'll be moving out soon against the enemy and I need every able hand we can muster.
dlga_lord_start:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints|{playername}, I need a volunteer to scout the area. We're sorely lacking on information, and I simply must have a better picture of the situation before we can proceed. I want you to go to {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and report back whatever you find.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted|You've found your volunteer, sir.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints:lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected|I fear I must decline.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_accepted:close_window|Good {man/lass}! Simply pass near {s13}, {s14} and {s15} and check out what's there. Make a note of anything you find and return to me as soon as possible.
dlga_lord_mission_told_scout_waypoints_rejected:lord_pretalk|Hm. I'm disappointed, {playername}. Very disappointed. We'll talk later, I need to go and find somebody to scout for us.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_thank:lord_generic_mission_completed|You have been most helpful, {playername}. My thanks.
dlga_lord_generic_mission_completed:lord_pretalk|It was an honour to serve.
dlga_lord_start:lord_pay_debt_2|I think you owe me {reg1} credits, {playername}. Do you intend to pay your debt anytime soon?
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_1|That is why I came, {s65}. Here it is, every denar I owe you.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_2:lord_pay_debt_3_2|Alas, I don't have sufficient funds, {s65}. But I'll pay you soon enough.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, excellent. You are a {man/woman} of honour, {playername}. I am satisfied, yopur debt to me has been paid in full.
dlga_lord_pay_debt_3_2:lord_pretalk|Well, don't keep me waiting much longer.
dlga_lord_start:lord_buy_prisoner|I heard that you have captured our enemy {s3} and they are with you at the moment. I can pay you {reg6} credits for them right now. You can wait for their family to pay the ransom of course, but there is no telling how long that will take, eh?
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_accept|I accept your offer. I'll leave {s3} to you for {reg6} credits.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner:lord_buy_prisoner_deny|I fear I can't accept your offer.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_accept:lord_pretalk|Excellent! Here's your {reg6} credits. I'll send some men to take them to our prison with due haste.
dlga_lord_buy_prisoner_deny:lord_pretalk|Mmm. As you wish, {playername}, but you'll not get a better offer. Take it from me.
dlga_lord_start:lord_talk|What is it?
dlga_lord_pretalk:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_hero_pretalk:lord_talk|Anything else?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_lend_companion_end|I should like {s14} returned to me, {s65}, if you no longer require {reg3?her:his} services.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk|You've too many men in your company already, {playername}. You could not lead any more at the moment.
dlga_lord_lend_companion_end:lord_pretalk.1|Certainly, {playername}. {reg3?She:He} is a bright {reg3?girl:fellow}, you're a lucky {man/woman} to have such worthy companions.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_to_collect_debt|I've come to collect the debt you owe to {s1}.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt:lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2|Oh. Well, {s1} did lend me some silver a ways back, but I've done them many favours in the past and I consider that money as my due payment.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2:convince_begin|{s1} considers it a debt. They asked me to speak to you on their behalf.
dlga_lord_ask_to_collect_debt_2:lord_pretalk|Then I will not press the matter any further.
dlga_convince_accept:close_window|My debt to {s8} has long been overdue and was a source of great discomfort to me. Thank you for accepting to take the money to them. Please give them these {reg10} credits and thank them on my behalf.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_to_make_peace|Please, {s64}, it's time to end this war between {s12} and {s13}.
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace:lord_ask_to_make_peace_2|Eh? I'm not sure I heard you right, {playername}. War is not easily forgotten by either side of the conflict, and I have a very long memory. Why should I take any interest in brokering peace with those dogs?
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:convince_begin|Perhaps I can talk you into it...
dlga_lord_ask_to_make_peace_2:lord_pretalk|Never mind, peace can wait for now.
dlga_convince_accept:close_window.1|You... have convinced me, {playername}. Very well then, you've my blessing to bring a peace offer to {s14}. I cannot guarantee they will accept it, but on the off-chance they do, I will stand by it.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady|I want you to take back your accusations against {s1}.
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2|What accusations? Everyone knows that she beds her stable boys and anyone else she can lay hands on while her husband is away. I merely repeat the words of many.
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_3|You will recant these lies, sirrah, or prove them against my sword!
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_2:lord_pretalk|If you say so...
dlga_lord_challenge_duel_for_lady_3:close_window|You are challenging me to a duel? How droll! As you wish, {playername}, it will be good sport to bash your head in.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered|I bring a message from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered:lord_pretalk|Oh? Let me see that... Well well well! It was good of you to bring me this, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, and give my regards to {s9} when you see them again.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_message_delivered_enemy|I bring a message from {s9}.
dlga_lord_message_delivered_enemy:close_window|Oh? Let me see that... Hmmm. It was good of you to bring me this, {playername}. Take my seal as proof that I've received it, with my thanks.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_deliver_message_prisoner|I bring a message from {s11}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2|Can it be true? Oh, thank you kindly, {playername}! You have brought hope and some small ray of light to these bleak walls. Perhaps one day I will be able to repay you.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a| 'Twas the least I could do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2a:close_window|You've no idea how grateful I am, {playername}. A thousand thanks and more.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2:lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b|Worry not, {s65}. You'll have ample opportunity once you are free again.
dlga_lord_deliver_message_prisoner_2b:close_window|Hah, of course, {playername}. My eternal thanks go with you.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer|Fear not, I am here to rescue you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2|By God, are you serious? What is your plan?
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_2:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3|A simple ruse, {s65}. If we exchange garments, I shall take your place here in prison, while you make your escape disguised as myself. I paid the guards a handsome bribe, with which I am sure they have already purchased half the wine stocks of the nearest cantina. With some luck they'll soon get so drunk they'd have trouble recognising their own mothers, let alone telling one of us from the other. At least not until you are safely away.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4|Hmm, it might just work... But what of you, my {friend/lady}? The guards won't take kindly to this trickery. You may end up spending some time in this cell yourself.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a|Not to worry, {s65}. The place is already starting to grow on me.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b|I shall be fine as long there is an ample reward waiting at the end.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|You are a brave soul indeed. I won't forget this.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|Of course, my {friend/lady}, of course! Come to me when you have regained your freedom, and perhaps I shall be able to repay the debt I owe you.
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6:close_window|Quickly, {s65}, let us change garments. It is past time you were away from here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced|{s66}, I wish to restore my old oath to {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_pretalk|That is too great a matter for me to decide, {playername}. You should seek out {s4}. Such clemency is his alone to grant or deny.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_ask_pardon_terms|{s11}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk|As you like, {s65}. I will accept your judgment.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.1|A shame, {s65}. A shame.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.2|Very well, go and die without me.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace|Aye, I am ready.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected|On second thought, no. I don't wish to be in your service again.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace.1|Aye, I agree to those terms.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected.1|That is too high a price, {s65}. I must decline.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace:lord_pretalk|Excellent. Though you strayed from us, {playername}, it gladdens all our hearts that you have found your way back to the right path. I hereby restore your homage to me. Rise once more as an honoured {man/warrior} in my service.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected:close_window|Then get out of my sight, traitor! Begone with you, and do not come back!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon|I wish to make peace with {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk|Do you indeed, {playername}? Then go and trip on your sword. Give us all peace.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.1|{playername}, you are a {lord/lady} without a master, holding lands in your name, without having allegience to any kingdom. As long as that continues, no ruler in this Galaxy would accept a lasting peace with you.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2|Hmm. I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername}, but there are some who see you as an enemy and will not be satisfied unless you pay tribute. All in all, you'd need to bring no less than {reg16} credits to make any friends in {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept|I have the money here. {reg16} credits.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny|I fear I cannot pay that much.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window|Excellent, {playername}. I'll use the coin to smooth the feathers of those that can oppose your pardon, and I'm sure that word will soon spread that you are no longer an enemy of {s4}.
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About the task you gave me...
dlga_lord_talk:lord_pay_mercenary|{s67}, I humbly request the weekly payment for my service.
dlga_lord_pay_mercenary:lord_pay_mercenary_2|Hmm, let me see... According to my ledgers, we owe you {reg8} credits for your work. Here you are.
dlga_lord_pay_mercenary_2:lord_pretalk|Thank you, sir.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service|{s66}, I have come to offer you my sword in vassalage!
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service.1|{s66}, I wish to become your sworn {man/woman} and fight for your honour.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_leave_service|{s66}, I wish to be released from my oath to you.

dlga_lord_give_order_stop:lord_pretalk|All right. I will do that.

dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, it won't be necessary to summon everyone.
dlga_lord_give_order_call_to_arms:lord_pretalk|All right then. I will send messengers and tell everyone to come here.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_disband_army_verify|I want to end the campaign and let everyone return home.

dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army_2:lord_pretalk|On second thought, it will be better to stay together for now.
dlga_lord_give_order_disband_army:lord_pretalk|All right. I will let everyone know that they are released from duty.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk_ask_something|I wish to ask you something.
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something:lord_talk_ask_something_2|Aye? What is it?
dlga_lord_talk_ask_something_2:lord_talk_ask_location|I want to know the location of someone.

dlga_knight_offer_join_accept_party:knight_join_party_lead_out|Lead your men off the planet. I shall catch up with you in orbit.
dlga_knight_offer_join_accept_party:knight_join_party_lead_out.1|Keep doing what you were doing. I'll catch up with you later.
dlga_knight_join_party_disband:close_window|Ah . . . Very well, {playername}. Much as I dislike losing good men, the decision is yours. I'll disband my troops and join you.
dlga_knight_join_party_join:close_window|Excellent. My lads and I will ride with you.
dlga_knight_join_party_lead_out:close_window|Very well then. I shall maintain a patrol of this area. Return if you have further orders for me.

dlga_lord_ask_enter_service:lord_pretalk.1|You've yet to show yourself as a competent commander, {playername}. Take your sword to my enemies and prove to me that you are worthy of becoming my vassal. Then we may speak more of this.
dlga_lord_give_oath_1:lord_give_oath_2|I am ready, {s65}.
dlga_lord_give_oath_1:lord_give_oath_give_up|Forgive me, {s65}, I must give the matter more thought first...
dlga_lord_give_oath_give_up:close_window|What are you playing at, {playername}? Go and make up your mind, and stop wasting my time.
dlga_lord_give_oath_2:lord_give_oath_3|Good. Then repeat the words of the oath with me: I swear homage to you as lawful ruler of the {s41}.
dlga_lord_give_oath_3:lord_give_oath_4|I pledge homage to you as lawful ruler of the {s41}.

dlga_lord_give_oath_5:lord_give_oath_6|I will remain as your loyal and devoted {man/follower} as long as my breath remains...
dlga_lord_give_oath_5:lord_give_oath_give_up|{reg65?My lady:Sir}, may I ask for some time to think about this?

dlga_lord_give_oath_7:lord_give_oath_8|...and I will be at your side to fight your enemies should you need my sword.
dlga_lord_give_oath_7:lord_give_oath_give_up|{reg65?My lady:My lord}, please give me more time to think about this.
dlga_lord_give_oath_8:lord_give_oath_9|Finally, I will uphold your lawful claims and those of your legitimate heirs.
dlga_lord_give_oath_9:lord_give_oath_10|Finally, I will uphold your lawful claims and those of your legitimate heirs.
dlga_lord_give_oath_9:lord_give_oath_give_up|{reg65?My lady:Sir}, I must have more time to consider this.
dlga_lord_give_oath_10:lord_give_oath_go_on_2|Very well. You have given me your solemn oath, {playername}. May you uphold it always, with proper courage and devotion.
dlga_lord_give_oath_go_on_2:lord_give_oath_go_on_3|Let it be known that from this day forward, you are my sworn {man/follower} and vassal.

dlga_lord_give_conclude_2:close_window.1|I have great hopes for you {playername}. I know you shall prove yourself worthy of the trust I have placed in you.
dlga_lord_ask_enter_service:lord_enter_service_swear|Heh, a wise move, {playername}. With loyal service, a {man/woman} in my service could become wealthy and powerful, and our enemies... Well, our enemies are as wheat before a scythe. However, to enter my service you must first renounce all worldly oaths and bonds, and swear to serve only the {s5}.
dlga_lord_enter_service_swear:lord_enter_service_swear_accepted|I do so swear, {s65}.
dlga_lord_enter_service_swear:lord_enter_service_swear_denied|I need some time to think about this.

dlga_lord_enter_service_swear_accepted_2:close_window|I charge you with rooting out and destroying the forces of our enemies wherever you may find them. Moreover, I will have special tasks for you from time to time, as may some of my other vassal lords. Serve, fight, and honour your oaths. These things will take you far, if you've a mind for promotion. May God grant us long lives and many victories to toast in my hall!
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify|Hrm. Has your oath become burdensome, {playername}? It is unusual to request release from homage, but in respect of your fine service, I will not hold you if you truly wish to end it. Though you would be sorely missed.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service:lord_ask_leave_service_verify.1|Release from homage? Hmm, perhaps it would be for the best... However, {playername}, you must be sure that release is what you desire. This is not a thing done lightly.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_2|It is something I must do, {s65}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify:lord_ask_leave_service_giveup|You are right, {s65}. My place is here.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_giveup:lord_pretalk|I am pleased to hear it, {playername}. I hope you'll banish such unworthy thoughts from your mind from now on.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_2:lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again|Then you are sure?
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again:lord_ask_leave_service_3|Yes, {s65}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_verify_again:lord_ask_leave_service_giveup|Of course not, {s65}. I am ever your loyal vassal.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_3:lord_ask_leave_service_end|As you wish. I hereby declare your oaths to be null and void. You will no longer hold land or titles in my name, and you are released from your duties to my house. You are free, {playername}.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_end:lord_ask_leave_service_end_2|Thank you, sir. It was an honour to serve you..
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_end:lord_ask_leave_service_end_2.1|My thanks. It feels good to be {a free man/free} once again.
dlga_lord_ask_leave_service_end_2:close_window|Farewell then, {playername}, and good luck go with you.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_lend_companion_end|Oh, you want your companion back? I see...
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_pretalk|{playername}, I must beg your patience, I still have need of your companion. Please return later when things have settled.
dlga_lord_active_mission_1:lord_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_generic_mission_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg1} {s1} as prisoners.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:capture_enemy_hero_thank|Oh, indeed. I've captured a lord from {s13} for you.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank:capture_enemy_hero_thank_2|Many thanks, my friend. They will serve very well for a bargain. You've done a fine work here. Please accept these {reg5} credits for your help.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Certainly, {s65}.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.1|It was nothing.
dlga_capture_enemy_hero_thank_2:lord_pretalk.2|Give me more of a challenge next time.

dlga_lord_raise_troops_thank:lord_raise_troops_thank_2|These men may well turn the tide in my plans, {playername}. I am confident you've trained them well. My thanks and my compliments to you.
dlga_lord_raise_troops_thank_2:lord_pretalk|Well, the lads are at your command now, sir. I am sure you will take good care of them.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_success|Here are all the taxes from {s3}. It comes up to {reg19} credits.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_half_success|Here are the taxes from {s3}. It comes up to {reg19} credits.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_collect_taxes_fail|Unfortunately, a revolt broke up while I was collecting the taxes. I could only collect {reg19} credits.
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_success:lord_pretalk|Well done, {playername}, very well done indeed! You were truly the right {man/person} for the job. I promised you a fifth of the taxes, so that amounts to {reg21} credits. If you give me {reg20} credits, you may keep the difference. A good result for everyone, eh?
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_half_success:lord_pretalk|What?! Is this some scheme of yours, {playername}? That's less than half the taxes I'm owed! You have let them get away with murder as well as my money. What a farce! You can forget the money I promised you, I'm taking {reg20} credits from what you collected, and you're lucky I'm leaving you a few coins for honour's sake.
dlga_lord_collect_taxes_fail:lord_pretalk|God, what a bloody mess you've gotten us into, {playername}.This could turn very ugly if I do not take immediate action.I certainly hope you're not here expecting to be paid for failure.Hand over my {reg19} credits, if you please, and end our business together.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success|I found {s4} hiding at {s3} and gave them their punishment.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail|I'm afraid he got away.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2|And we'll all be a lot better off without them! Thank you, {playername}, for removing this long-festering thorn from my side. 'Tis good to know you can be trusted to handle things with an appropriate level of tactfulness. A bounty I promised, and a bounty you shall have. 300 credits!
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept|Let me take the money, {s65}. Thank you.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject|This is blood money. I can't accept it.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:lord_pretalk|Of course, {playername}. Here you are. Once again, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s44}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject:lord_pretalk|You are a {man/woman} for whom justice is its own reward, eh? As you wish it, {playername}, as you wish it. An honourable sentiment, to be true. Regardless, you've my thanks for ridding me of that {s44}.
dlga_lord_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:lord_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s44} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_lord_active_mission_2:lord_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this quest.
dlga_lord_active_mission_3:lord_pretalk|Good. Remember, I am counting on you.

dlga_lord_suggets_attack_enemy_castle2:lord_suggets_attack_enemy_castle3|{s1} of {s2}
dlga_lord_suggets_attack_enemy_castle2:lord_pretalk|Never mind my lord.

dlga_lord_suggest_action:lord_pretalk.1|Nothing, {s65}. It's not important.
dlga_lord_request_mission_ask:lord_propose_mercenary|Warning: This line should never display.
dlga_lord_propose_mercenary:lord_mercenary_service|As it happens, {playername}, I promised {s10} that I would hire a company of mercenaries for an upcoming campaign. What do you say to entering the service of {s9} as a mercenary captain? I've no doubt that you would be up to the task.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_reject|I'm not interested, thank you.
dlga_lord_mercenary_service:lord_mercenary_service_accept|Aye, I'll join {s9}.

dlga_lord_mercenary_service_elaborate_duty:lord_mercenary_elaborate_1|Duties... There are only a few, none of them difficult. The very first thing is to declare your allegiance. An oath of loyalty to our cause. Once that's done, you shall be required to fulfill certain responsibilities.

If you go there and raise the taxes they owe me, I will grant you one-fifth of everything you collect.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted|A fair offer, {s65}. We have an agreement.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_told:lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected|Forgive me, I don't have the time.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_accepted:close_window|Welcome news, {playername}. I will entrust this matter to you. Remember, those {reg9?townsmen:peasants} are foxy beasts, they will make every excuse not to pay me my rightful incomes. Do not let them fool you.
dlga_lord_mission_collect_taxes_rejected:lord_pretalk|Oh, yes. Well, good luck to you then.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my men and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. I can't let him get away with avoiding justice, so I've put a bounty of 300 credits on his head. Friends of the murdered man reckon that this assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves, and claim the bounty for yourself.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|Then I will hunt him down and execute the law.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after him at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man he murdered. And of course the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get him. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_lord_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant|The wretched truth is that I owe a considerable sum of money to one of the merchants here in {s3}. I've no intention of paying it back, of course, but that loud-mouthed fool is making a terrible fuss about it. He even had the audacity to come and threaten me -- me! -- with a letter of complaint to the trade guilds and bankers. Why, he'd ruin my good reputation! So I need a {man/woman} I can trust, someone who will guarantee the man's silence. For good.
dlga_lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant:lord_mission_accepted_kill_local_merchant|Worry not, he shan't breathe a word.
dlga_lord_mission_told_kill_local_merchant:lord_mission_rejected|I'm no common murderer, sir. Find someone else for your dirty job.
dlga_lord_mission_accepted_kill_local_merchant:close_window|Very good. I trust in your skill and discretion, {playername}. Do not disappoint me. Go now and wait for my word, I'll send you a message telling when and where you can catch the merchant. Dispose of him for me and I shall reward you generously.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town|I have a sensitive matter which needs tending to, {playername}, and no trustworthy retainers to take care of it. The fact is that I have a spy in {s13} to keep an eye on things for me, and report anything that might warrant my attention. Every week I send someone to collect the spy's reports and bring them back to me. The job's yours if you wish it.
dlga_lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted|I don't mind a bit of skullduggery. Count me in.
dlga_lord_mission_told_meet_spy_in_enemy_town:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected|I must decline. This cloak-and-dagger work isn't fit for me.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Excellent! Make your way to {s13} as soon as you can, the spy will be waiting.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2|{s13} is heavily defended. How can I get close without being noticed?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_2:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|You shall have to use stealth. Take care to avoid enemy strongholds, villages and patrols, and don't bring too many men with you. If you fail to sneak in the first time, give it a while for the garrison to lower its guard again, or you may have a difficult time infiltrating the planet.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3|How will I recognise the spy?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_3:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Once you get to {s13} you must talk to the locals, the spy will be one of them. If you think you've found the spy, say the phrase '{s11}' The spy will respond with the phrase '{s12}' Thus you will know the other, and {reg7?she:he} will give you any information {reg7?she:he}'s gathered in my service.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4|Will I be paid?
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_4:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response|Of course, I have plenty of silver in my coffers for loyal {men/women} like you. Do well by me, {playername}, and you'll rise high.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_response:quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_end|I know what to do. Farewell, my lord.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_accepted_end:lord_pretalk|Good luck, {playername}. Remember, the secret phrase is '{s11}' The counterphrase is '{s12}' Bring any reports back to me, and I'll compensate you for your trouble.
dlga_quest_meet_spy_in_enemy_town_rejected:lord_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}, but I strongly advise you to forget anything I told you about any spies. They do not exist, have never existed, and no one will ever find them. Remember that.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war|This peace with {s13} ill suits me, {playername}. We've let those swine have their way for far too long. Now they get stronger with each passing and their arrogance knows no bounds. I say, we must wage war on them before it's too late! Unfortunately, some of the bleeding hearts among our realm's lords are blocking a possible declaration of war. Witless cowards with no stomach for blood.
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2|You are right, {s65}, but what can we do?
dlga_lord_mission_told_raid_caravan_to_start_war:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1|I disagree, sir. Peace is prefarable to war.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_2:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3|Ah, 'tis good to hear someone who understands! As a matter of fact, there is something we can do, {playername}. A little bit of provocation. The dogs in {s13} are very fond of their merchant caravans, and rely on them overmuch. If one of our war parties managed to enter their territory and pillage some of their caravans, they would have ample cause to declare war on our kingdom. And then, well, even the cowards among us must rise to defend themselves. So what do you say? Are you interested?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|An excellent plan. Count me in.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_3:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4|Why don't you raid the caravans yourself?
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_4:lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5|Well, {playername}, some of the lords in our kingdom won't like the idea of someone inciting a war without their consent. They are already looking for an excuse to get at me, and if I did this they could make me pay for it dearly. You, on the other hand, are young and well liked and daring, so you might just get away with it. And of course I will back you up and defend your actions against your opponents. All in all, a few lords might be upset at your endeavour, but I am sure you won't be bothered with that.
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted|Then I will go and raid those caravans!
dlga_lord_mission_tell_raid_caravan_to_start_war_5:quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2|I don't like this. Find yourself someone else to take the blame for your schemes.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_accepted:close_window|Very good! Now, don't forget that you must capture and loot at least {reg13} caravans to make sure that those fools in {s13} get really infuriated. Once you do that, return to me and make sure you are not captured by their patrols. If they catch you, our plan will fail without a doubt and you will be facing a long time in prisons. Now, good luck and good hunting to you.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_1:lord_pretalk|Ah, you think so? But how long will your precious peace last? Not long, believe me.
dlga_quest_raid_caravan_to_start_war_rejected_2:lord_pretalk|Hm. As you wish, {playername}. I thought you had some fire in you, but it seems I was wrong.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.1|Well, some of the serfs working my fields in {s4} have run away. The ungrateful swine, I let them plough my fields and rent my cottages, and this is how they repay me! From what I've been hearing, they're running to {s3} as fast as they can, and have split up into three groups to try and avoid capture. I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary. I should really have them hanged for attempting to escape, but we need hands for the upcoming harvest, so I'll let them go off this time with a good beating.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy|I have good information that a man on this very planet is actually an enemy spy. He should be seized and hanged for his impudence, but we also believe that very soon he will leave the planet to meet with his master, the man to whom the spy feeds all his little whispers. The spy himself is of little import, but the master is a dangerous man, and could tell us a great deal if we could only get our hands on him...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2|I want you to wait here until the spy leaves the planet. Then you must follow him, stealthily, to the meeting place. You must take absolute care not to be seen by the spy on your way, else he may suspect foul play and turn back. When the master appears, you must ambush and arrest them and bring the pair back to me. Alive, if you please.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted|I'll do it, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_2:lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected|No, this skulking is not for me.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_accepted:close_window|Good, I'm sure you'll do a fine job of it. One of my men will point the spy out to you when he leaves, so you will know the man to follow. Remember, I want them both, and I want them alive.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_follow_spy_rejected:lord_pretalk|A shame. Well, carry on as you were, {playername}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero|There is a difficult job I need done, {playername}, and you may be the {man/one} who can carry it off. I need someone to capture one of the noble lords of {s13} and bring them to me. Afterwards, I'll be able to exchange them in return for a relative of mine held by {s13}. It is a simple enough job, but whomever you choose will be guarded by an elite band of personal retainers. Are you up for a fight?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted|Consider it done, {s65}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero:lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected|I must refuse, {s65}. I am not a kidnapper.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_accepted:close_window|I like your spirit! Go and bring me one of our enemies, and I'll toast your name in my hall when you return! And reward you for your efforts, of course...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_capture_enemy_hero_rejected:lord_pretalk|Clearly you lack the mettle I had thought you possessed. Very well, {playername}, I will find someone else.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion|I don't have a job for you right now, but your companion {s3} is a skilled {reg3?lass:fellow} and I need someone with {reg3?her:his} talents. Will you lend {reg3?her:him} to me for a while?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2|How long will you be needing {reg3?her:him}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_2:lord_mission_lend_companion_told|Just a few days, a week at most.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted|Then I will leave {s3} with you for one week.
dlga_lord_mission_lend_companion_told:lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected|I am sorry, but I cannot do without {s3} for a whole week.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_accepted:close_window|I cannot thank you enough, {playername}. Worry not, your companion shall be returned to you with due haste.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_lend_companion_rejected:lord_pretalk|Well, that's damned unfortunate, but I suppose I cannot force you or {s3} to agree. I shall have to make do without.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt|Some time ago, I loaned out a considerable sum of money to {s3}. {reg4} credits, to be precise. They were supposed to pay it back within a month but I haven't received a credit from them since. That was months ago. If you could collect the debt from them on my behalf, I would be grateful indeed. I would even let you keep one fifth of the money for your trouble. What do you say?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2|Do you know where I can find {s3}, {s65}?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_2:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3|If you leave now, you should be able to find them at {s4}. I've no doubt that they will be suitably embarassed by their conduct and give you all the money that is owed.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted|Then I will talk to {s3} on your behalf.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_3:lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected|Forgive me, {s65}, but I doubt I would be more successful than yourself.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_accepted:close_window|You made me very happy by accepting this {playername}. Please, talk to {s3} and don't leave without my money.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_collect_debt_rejected:lord_pretalk|Perhaps not, {playername}. I suppose I'm never getting that money back...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander|I tell you, that blubbering fool {s13} is not fit to rule {s14}. God knows they would be divested of their lands in an instant were it not for one of their loyal vassals, {s15}. As long as they have vassals adding them, it will be a difficult job beating them. So I need to get {s15} out of the picture, and I have a plan just to do that... With your help, naturally.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2|{s66}, I am all ears.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|I don't wish to involve myself in anything dishonourable against {s15}.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected:lord_pretalk|Dishonourable? Bah! I was hoping I could count on you, {playername}, but you've shown me what a fool I was. I shall have to find someone whose loyalty I can trust.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_2:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3|I have written a fake letter to {s15}, bearing my own seal, which implicates them in a conspiracy with us to stage a coup in {s14}, in my favour. If we can make {s13} believe the letter is genuine, they will deal with {s15} very swiftly. Of course, the challenge there is to convince {s13} that the letter is indeed real...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4|Please continue, {s65}...
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_3:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I will not sully myself with this dishonourable scheme.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_4:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5|This is where you come into play. You'll take the letter to {s14}, then give it to one of your soldiers and instruct them to take it to {s15}. I will have one of my spies inform the planet garrison so that your man will be arrested on his way. The guards will then find the letter and take it to {s13}. They'll torture your man, of course, to try and get the truth out of them, but all he knows is that you ordered the letter to be delivered to {s15} under the utmost secrecy. {s13} knows you serve me, and the fool will certainly believe the whole charade.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_5:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7|Is that all?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_7:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8|There is one more thing... Your messenger must be someone trustworthy. If you sent the letter with a simple peasant, someone expendable, {s13} might suspect a plot. He may have the wits of a snail, but even a snail can see the obvious. Give the letter to someone of rank. One of your {s9}, perhaps.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9|What? I can't send one of my trusted {s9} to his death!
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_8:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|Then a {s8} it will be.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_9:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10|Come now, {playername}. There is a place for sentimentality, but this is not it. Believe me, you shall be generously compensated, and what is the purpose of soldiers if not to die at our say-so?
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin|A {s8} it is.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_10:lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_rejected|No, I'll not sacrifice one of my chosen men.
dlga_lord_tell_mission_incriminate_commander_fin:lord_pretalk|I can't tell you how pleased I am to hear that, {playername}. You are removing one of the greatest obstacles in my path. Here is the letter, as well as 300 credits for your expenses. Remember, there'll be more once you succeed. Much, much more...
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told.2|A group of my soldiers were captured in a recent skirmish with the enemy. Thankfully we have a mutual agreement of prisoner exchange, and they will release my men, but they want us to give them prisoners of equal rank and number. Prisoners I don't currently have. So, I need a good {man/warrior} to find me {reg1} {s3} as prisoners, that I may exchange them.
dlga_lord_tell_mission:lord_pretalk|No {playername}. I do not need your help at this time.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_accepted|You can count on me, {s65}.
dlga_lord_mission_told:lord_mission_rejected|I fear I cannot accept such a mission at the moment.
dlga_lord_mission_accepted:close_window|Excellent, {playername}, excellent. I have every confidence in you.
dlga_lord_mission_rejected:close_window|Is that so? Well, I suppose you're just not up to the task. I shall have to look for somebody with more mettle.
dlga_lord_talk:lord_leave_prison|I must leave now.

dlga_lord_leave_give_quest:enemy_lord_tell_mission|I am listening.
dlga_enemy_lord_tell_mission:lord_mission_told|I have a friend here, an old warrior, who is very sick.

dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. You tried. The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honour. That alone will convince many of my innocence.
dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.

We have tried to negotiate their ransom, but it has been set too high. We can never hope to raise that much money without selling everything we own, and God knows {s13} would rather spend their life in prison than make us destitute. Instead I came up with a plan to get them out of there, but it requires someone to make a great sacrifice, and so far my pleas have fallen on deaf ears...

One of the most insidious is {s13}.They are going around making terrible accusations against me, impugning my honour at every turn! Because they cannot harm my husband directly, they are using me as a target to try and stain our name. You should hear the awful things they have said!

dlga_lady_talk:lady_restore_relation|I want to improve my relation with a lord. Can you help me?
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_pretalk|{playername}, I don't know you well enough to act on your behalf. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_restore_relation:lady_restore_relation_2|Hmm. I guess you got on the wrong side of somebody. Very well, who do you want to restore your relation with?
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_restore_relation_2b|{s1}
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2:lady_pretalk|Never mind. I get along with everyone well enough.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_2b:lady_restore_relation_3|Well I can try to help you there. I am sure a few expensive gifts will make {s10} look at you more favorably.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_3:lady_restore_relation_4|You can improve your relation with {s10} by sending {reg4?her:him} a gift worth {reg10} credits. But if you can afford spending {reg11} credits on the gift, it would make a good impression on {reg4?her:him}. And if you can go up to {reg12} credits, that would really help smooth things out.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5|I think a gift of {reg10} credits will do.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.1|Maybe I can afford {reg11} credits.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_5.2|In that case, I am ready to spend {reg12} credits.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_4:lady_restore_relation_cant_afford|I don't think I can afford a gift at the moment.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_5:lady_restore_relation_6|Excellent. Then I'll choose an appropriate gift for you and send it to {s10} with your compliments. I am sure {reg4?she:he} will appreciate the gesture.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_6:lady_pretalk|Thank you for your help, madame.
dlga_lady_restore_relation_cant_afford:lady_pretalk|I am afraid, I can't be of much help in that case, {playername}. I am sorry.
dlga_lady_talk:lady_leave|I must beg my leave.
dlga_lady_leave:close_window|Farewell, {playername}.
dlga_convince_begin:convince_options|I still don't see why I should accept what you're asking of me.
dlga_convince_options:convince_bribe|Then I'll make it worth your while. ({reg8} credits)
dlga_convince_options:convince_friendship|Please, do it for the sake of our friendship. (-{reg9} to relation)
dlga_convince_options:convince_persuade_begin|Let me try and convince you. (Persuasion)
dlga_convince_options:lord_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_convince_bribe:convince_bribe_verify|Mmm, a generous gift to my coffers would certainly help matters... {reg8} credits should do it. If you agree, then I'll go with your suggestion.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_cant_afford|I'm afraid my finances will not allow for such a gift.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_bribe_goon|Very well, please accept these {reg8} credits as a token of my gratitude.
dlga_convince_bribe_verify:convince_begin|Let me think about this some more.
dlga_convince_bribe_cant_afford:convince_options|Ah. In that case, there is little I can do, unless you have some further argument to make.
dlga_convince_bribe_goon:convince_accept|My dear {playername}, your generous gift has led me to reconsider what you ask, and I have come to appreciate the wisdom of your proposal.
dlga_convince_friendship:convince_friendship_verify|You've done well by me in the past, {playername}, and for that I will go along with your request, but know that I do not like you using our relationship this way.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:convince_friendship_go_on|I am sorry, my friend, but I need your help in this.
dlga_convince_friendship_verify:lord_pretalk|If it will not please you, then I'll try something else.
dlga_convince_friendship_go_on:convince_accept|All right then, {playername}, I will accept this for your sake. But remember, you owe me for this.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk|I don't think I owe you such a favor {playername}. I see no reason to accept this for you.
dlga_convince_friendship:lord_pretalk.1|Is this a joke? You've some nerve asking me for favours, {playername}, and let me assure you you'll get none.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:convince_persuade_begin_2|Very well. Make your case.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_persuade|[Attempt to persuade]
dlga_convince_persuade_begin_2:convince_begin|Wait, perhaps there is another way to convince you.
dlga_convince_persuade_begin:lord_pretalk|By God's grace, {playername}! Haven't we talked enough already? I am tired of listening to you, and I do not want to hear any more of it right now.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_accept|All right, all right. You have persuaded me to it. I'll go ahead with what you suggest.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options|You've a point, {playername}, I'll admit that much. However I am not yet convinced I should do as you bid.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.1|Enough, {playername}. You've a lot of arguments, but I find none of them truly convincing. I stand by what I said before.
dlga_convince_persuade:convince_options.2|Truthfully, {playername}, I fail to see the virtue of your reasoning. What you ask for makes even less sense now than it did before.
dlga_start:siege_won_seneschal_1|I must congratulate you on your victory, my {lord/lady}. Welcome to {s1}. We, the housekeepers of this castle, are at your service.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_1:siege_won_seneschal_2|Are you the seneschal?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_2:siege_won_seneschal_3|Indeed I am, my {lord/lady}. I have always served the masters of {s1} to the best of my ability, whichever side they might be on. Thus you may count on my utmost loyalty for as long as you are the {lord/lady} of this place. Now, do you intend to keep me on as the seneschal? I promise you will not be disappointed.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4|Very well, you may keep your post for the time being.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_3:siege_won_seneschal_4.1|You can stay, but I shall be keeping a close watch on you.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_4:siege_won_seneschal_5|Thank you, my {lord/lady}. If you do not mind my impudence, may I inquire as to what you wish to do with the castle?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6|I will sell it to another lord.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_6.1|I intend to claim it for myself.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_5:siege_won_seneschal_list_options|I haven't given it much thought. What are my options?
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask them to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any one with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. 
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces. 
dlga_start:seneschal_intro_1|Good day, {sir/madam}. I do nott believe I've seen you here before. Let me extend my welcome to you as the seneschal of {s1}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1a|A pleasure to meet you, {s65}.
dlga_seneschal_intro_1a:seneschal_talk|How can I help you?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1:seneschal_intro_1b|What exactly do you do here?
dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a seneschal's duties are many, good {sire/woman}. For example, I collect the rents from my lord's estates, I manage the castle's storerooms, I deal with the local peasantry, I take care of castle staff, I arrange supplies for the garrison... All mundane matters on this fief are my responsibility, on behalf of my lord. Everything except commanding the soldiers themselves.
dlga_start:seneschal_talk|Good day, {sir/madam}.
dlga_seneschal_pretalk:seneschal_talk|Anything else?
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_something|I would like to ask you a question...
dlga_seneschal_talk:seneschal_ask_about_someone|I wish to know more about someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone:seneschal_ask_about_someone_2|Perhaps I may be able to help. Whom did you have in mind?
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_2:seneschal_ask_about_someone_3|{s1}
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_2:seneschal_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_3:seneschal_ask_about_someone_4|{s2}{s1}
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_relation:seneschal_ask_about_someone_4|{reg1?She:He} hates {s51}.
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_4:seneschal_ask_about_someone_relation|Where does {s1} stand with others?.
dlga_seneschal_ask_about_someone_4:seneschal_pretalk|My thanks, that was helpful.
dlga_seneschal_talk:close_window|I must take my leave of you now. Farewell.
dlga_seneschal_ask_something:seneschal_ask_something_2|I'll do what I can to help, of course. What did you wish to ask?
dlga_seneschal_ask_something_2:seneschal_ask_location|Perhaps you know where to find someone...
dlga_seneschal_ask_location:seneschal_ask_location_2|Well, a man in my position does hear a lot of things. Of whom were you thinking?
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_ask_location_3|{s1}
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_2:seneschal_pretalk|Never mind.
dlga_seneschal_ask_location_3:seneschal_pretalk|{s1}
dlga_start:close_window.4|There! I can see the walls of {s3} in the distance. We've made it safely. Here, take this purse of {reg3} credits, as I promised. I hope we can travel together again someday.
dlga_start:talk_caravan_escort|We've made it this far... Is everything clear up ahead?
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2a|There might be bandits nearby. Stay close.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2a:close_window|Trust me, {playername}, we're already staying as close to you as we can. Lead the way.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort:talk_caravan_escort_2b|No sign of trouble, we can breathe easy.
dlga_talk_caravan_escort_2b:close_window|I'll breathe easy when we reach {s1} and not a moment sooner. Let's keep moving.
dlga_start:merchant_talk|What do you want? We paid our toll to you less than three days ago.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.1|Hail, friend.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.2|What do you want? We are but simple merchants, we've no quarrel with you, so leave us alone.
dlga_start:merchant_talk.3|Be warned, knave! This caravan is under the protection of {s9}. Step out of our way or you will face his fury!
dlga_start:merchant_talk.4|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_merchant_pretalk:merchant_talk|Anything else?
dlga_merchant_talk:caravan_start_war_quest_1|You are trespassing in {s17} territory. I am confiscating this caravan and all its goods!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_1:caravan_start_war_quest_2|What? What nonsense is this? We are nowhere near your territory, {mate/wench}, and moreover we have a peace treaty with {s17}!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:merchant_attack|We'll see about that! Defend yourselves!
dlga_caravan_start_war_quest_2:close_window|Never mind, 'twas but a joke. Farewell.
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_talk_offer|I have an offer for you.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer:merchant_talk_offer_2|What is it?
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:caravan_offer_protection|I can escort you to your destination for a price.
dlga_merchant_talk_offer_2:merchant_pretalk|Nothing. Forget it
dlga_merchant_talk:merchant_demand|I demand something from you!
dlga_merchant_demand:merchant_demand_2|What do you want?
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_demand_toll|There is a toll for free passage here!
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2|Please, I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} credits, just let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll:merchant_demand_toll_2.1|I don't want any trouble. I can give you {reg6} credits if you'll let us go.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_demand_toll_accept|Agreed, hand it over and you may go in peace.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_accept:close_window|Very well then. Here's {reg6} credits. 
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_pretalk|I changed my mind, I can't take your money.
dlga_merchant_demand_toll_2:merchant_attack|No, I want everything you have! [Attack]
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_attack_begin|Hand over your gold and valuables now!
dlga_merchant_demand_2:merchant_pretalk|Nothing. Forget it.
dlga_merchant_attack_begin:merchant_attack_verify|Are you robbing us?
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack_verify_norob|Robbing you? No, no! It was a joke.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify_norob:close_window|God, don't joke about that, {lad/lass}. For a moment I thought we were in real trouble.
dlga_merchant_attack_verify:merchant_attack|Of course I'm robbing you. Now hand over your goods.
dlga_merchant_attack:close_window|Damn you, you won't get anything from us without a fight!
dlga_caravan_offer_protection:caravan_offer_protection_2|These roads are dangerous indeed. One can never have enough protection.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:close_window|An escort? We're almost there already! Thank you for the offer, though.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_2:caravan_offer_protection_3|We are heading to {s1}. I will pay you {reg2} credits if you escort us there.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4|Agreed.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4:caravan_offer_protection_5|I want you to stay close to us along the way. We'll need your help if we get ambushed by bandits.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_5:caravan_offer_protection_6|Don't worry, you can trust me.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_6:close_window|Good. Come and collect your money when we're within sight of {s1}. For now, let's just get underway.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_3:caravan_offer_protection_4b|Forget it.
dlga_caravan_offer_protection_4b:close_window|Perhaps another time, then.
dlga_merchant_talk:talk_caravan_enemy_2|Not so fast. First, hand over all your goods and money.
dlga_talk_caravan_enemy_2:close_window|Never. It is our duty to protect these goods. You shall have to fight us, brigand!
dlga_merchant_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_start:prison_guard_players|Good day, my {lord/lady}. Will you be visiting the prison?
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window|Yes. Unlock the door.
dlga_prison_guard_players:close_window.1|No, not now.
dlga_start:prison_guard_talk|Yes? What do you want?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_ask_prisoners|Who is imprisoned here?
dlga_prison_guard_talk:prison_guard_visit_prison|I want to speak with a prisoner.
dlga_prison_guard_ask_prisoners:prison_guard_talk|Currently, {s51} {reg1?are:is} imprisoned here.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:close_window|Of course, {sir/madam}. Go in.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_2|You need to get permission from the lord to talk to prisoners.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:close_window|All right then. I'll try that.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:prison_guard_visit_prison_3|Come on now. I thought you were the boss here.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_3:prison_guard_visit_prison_4|He-heh. You got that right. Still, I can't let you into the prison.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:close_window|All right then. I'll leave now.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_prison_5|I found a purse with 100 credits a few paces away. I reckon it belongs to you.
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_5:close_window|Ah! I was looking for this all day. How good of you to bring it back {sir/madam}. Well, now that I know what an honest {man/lady} you are, there can be no harm in letting you inside. Go in.
dlga_prison_guard_talk:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_start:castle_guard_players|Your orders, {Lord/Lady}?
dlga_castle_guard_players:close_window|Open the door. I'll go in.

dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:castle_guard_intro_2|I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_1:close_window|Never mind.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:castle_guard_intro_2|You can go in after leaving your weapons with me. No one is allowed to carry arms into the main hall.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:close_window|Here, take my arms. I'll go in.
dlga_castle_guard_intro_2:castle_guard_intro_2b|No, I give my arms to no one.

dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine|Vine aquí para entregarte {reg9} unidades de {s4}.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine:tavernkeeper_pretalk|At last! My stock was almost depleted. I had paid the cost of the {s4} in advance. Here, take these {reg5} credits. That should cover your pay. And give {s9} my regards. I'll put in a good word for you next time I deal with them.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost some of the cargo on the way.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_incomplete:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Attacked by bandits eh? You are lucky they left you alive. Anyway, I can pay you no more than {reg5} credits for this. And I will let {s1} know that my order was delivered less than completely, so you will probably be charged for this loss.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost|I was told to deliver you {reg9} units of {s4}, but I lost the cargo on the way.
dlga_tavernkeeper_deliver_wine_lost:tavernkeeper_pretalk|What? I was waiting for that {s4} for weeks! And now you are telling me that you lost it? You may rest assured that I will let {s1} know about this.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_buy_peasants|Quiero contratar algunos soldados. ¿Puedes ayudarme?
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_peasants:tavernkeeper_buy_peasants_2|I don't think anyone from this planet will follow somebody like you. Try your luck elsewhere.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_peasants:tavernkeeper_buy_peasants_2.1|I know a few fellows who would follow you if you paid for their equipment.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_peasants_2:tavernkeeper_talk|¿Algo más?
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_request_mission_ask|I want to make some money, are there any contracts available?
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_active_mission_1|About the contract you gave me...
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_1:tavernkeeper_active_mission_2|Yes, have you made any progress on it?
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success|I found {s4} hiding at {s3} and gave them their punishment.
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_fail|I'm afraid they got away.
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_2:tavernkeeper_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_2:tavernkeeper_mission_failed|I am afraid I won't be able to do this contract.
dlga_tavernkeeper_active_mission_3:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I see. Well why are you still here?
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_failed:tavernkeeper_pretalk|{s43}
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2|Well done, {playername}!  'Tis good to know you can be trusted to handle things with an appropriate level of tactfulness. A bounty I promised, and a bounty you shall have. 300 credits even!
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept|Let me take the money, {s65}. Thank you.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_success_2:tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject|This is blood money. I can't accept it.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_accept:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Of course, {playername}. Here you are.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject:tavernkeeper_pretalk|You are a {s25} for whom justice is its own reward, eh? As you wish it, {playername}, as you wish it. An honourable sentiment, to be true.
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:tavernkeeper_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s44} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.
dlga_tavernkeeper_request_mission_ask:tavernkeeper_tell_mission|So you reckon yourself a bounty hunter, eh?
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|Actually there is one. It seems someone doesn't realize the Clone Wars are over. You know, the typical CIS officer, who goes by the name of {s4}. Anyway, he is assembling an army at {s3}, and the locals want something quick and clean. If you find, and elimiate him, you'll be given 300 credits.
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told.1|Yes, and nothing very complicated. A simple farmer named {s4} who has a territorial dispute with a local businessman at {s3}. He is armed, but is not really dangerous. You go, you finish him, and you return for your payment. It will be 300 credits once finished.
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told.2|Yes. And it seems it's something special this time because there is no customer, and no why. The target you would have to eliminate is called {s4} and is now on {s3}. I've been told he is ready to face anything and the payment for this job is 300 credits.
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told.3|Yeah, there is. An issue with a pirate named {s4}. It seems that his gang was intercepted during some sort of sabotage but he managed to get to an escape pod. He has been causing problems for the locals at {s3} ever since. The price is 300 credits.
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told.4|Yes, but it might be difficult. It seems a certain customer is being hunted down by a certain mercenary. Well trained, well armoured... Yeah, contract versus contract. Go to {s3} and eliminate a bountyhunter named {s4}. If you succeed you'll be rewarded with 300 credits.
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told.5|Yeah, a Hutt is quite upset at a smuggler named {s4}. Apparently he dropped his cargo right before being boarded by some Imperials... Anyway, he's believed to be at {s3} and the reward is 300 credits.
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_pretalk|I'm sorry, but I don't have any contracts for you right now.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted|I will claim this contract.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected|I am too busy to go after them at the moment.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. The customer will be so grateful to have them....found. Once you deal with this just return here for your reward. Well, good hunting to you.
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:tavernkeeper_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done...

dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end|Let everyone know of the generosity of {playername} to the people of {s10}.

dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_troops:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_troops_2|Of course, {my lord/my lady}. I reckon {reg5} denars should be enough for that. What should I tell the lads?
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_troops_2:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_troops_end|The price is fair enough, let my men have at it.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_troops_end:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Don't worry {sir/madam}. Your men will enjoy their pints.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_troops_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Actually, cancel that order.
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_pretalk|Actually, cancel that order.
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I guess I should leave now.
dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {sir/madam}. You look like someone who should get to know me.
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Why is that?
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets on the coast, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?
dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heartwarming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his cowshed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! And if in the end they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants who are looking for galley slaves. One cannot do Heaven's work with an empty purse, you see.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What can I get for a prisoner?
dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in the Galaxy, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course. I'm welcome on every planet in the Galaxy. There's not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of credits buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
dlga_start:ransom_broker_talk|Greetings. If you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|Anyway, if you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got prisoners to sell.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_intro_2|Tell me about what you do again.
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:close_window|Not this time. Good-bye.
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2|Let me see what you have...
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|I will be staying here for a few days. Let me know if you need my services.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across the Galaxy and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meager price of course.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at a cantina in {s11} some days ago. I thought you might like to know.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Thanks. I'll go and find {reg3?her:him} there.
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|Calradia is divided between rival kingdoms, which can neither manage to live in peace with their neighbours, nor completely eliminate them. As a result, there's seldom a break to the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its life blood. Well, at least this must be a good place to be for an adventurer such as yourself. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4.1|The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract. However the real rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king. A vassal can own planets and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these locations. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinugishes {himself/herself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {him/her} the right to own land.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|The only path closed to a an adventurer such as you would be becoming the {king/queen} of a kingdom. The people and nobles of these lands would never accept an upstart adventurer as their ruler. But don't think that kings can sit on their thrones too comfortably, either. They have their own rivals, those who are born to the right family, who could go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current king. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the king one day.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretender_location:tavern_traveler_pretender_location_ask|Whose location do you want to know?

dlga_start:fs_bookseller_talk|Hello there, I sense you have some ability with the force. I can train you but would ask for a small donation. Are you interested?

dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_1:farmer_from_bandit_village_2|What is the matter, my good man?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_1:farmer_from_bandit_village_2.1|What are you blurbing about peasant? Speak out.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_2:farmer_from_bandit_village_3|A band of brigands have taken refuge in our village. They take everything we have, force us to serve them, and do us much evil. If one of us so much as breathes a word of protest, they kill the poor soul on the spot right away. Our lives have become unbearable. I risked my skin and ran away to find someone who can help us.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_3:farmer_from_bandit_village_4|Why don't you go to the lord of your village? He should take care of the vermin.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_4:farmer_from_bandit_village_5|I did, {sir/madam}, but our lord's men did not let me see him and said they were occupied with more important matters and that we should deal with our own problem ourselves. Please {sir/madam}, you look like a {man/lady} of valor and a fearsome warrior, and you have no doubt many friends and soldiers at your service. If there is anyone who can help us, it's you.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_accepted|Very well, I'll help you. Where is this village?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_denied|I can't be bothered with this right now.
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_5:farmer_from_bandit_village_barter|Why would I fight these bandits? What's in it for me?
dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_accepted:close_window|God bless you, {sir/madam}. Our planet is {s7}. It is not too far from here.

dlga_farmer_from_bandit_village_barter:farmer_from_bandit_village_5|We are but poor farmers {sir/madam}, and the bandits have already got most of what we have on this world. but we'll be glad to share with you whatever we have got. And we'll always be in your gratitude if you help us.
dlga_start:close_window.20|Thank you for helping us {sir/madam}. Crush those bandits!

dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:close_window|Sorry. I don't need any other men right now.
dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {lad/lass}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {his/her} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word, you won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.
dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I can move on to practice.
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.
dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager for practice. Let's see what you will do.
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight. 
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry, even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on a speeder.
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have shield?
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A speeder may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier while on a speeder. However you must pay particular attention to speeder-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your speeder without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your speeder.]
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training. But if you want you can still practice. Are you ready?
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {lad/lass}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {lad/lass}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on your opponents will be veteran fighters; soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defense up.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {lad/lass}, and the sword arm to match. From now on your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such a promising talent. You have passed all tiers of training. You can now tell everyone that you have been trained by the master of the training field.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training:novicemaster_finish_training_2|Thank you master.
dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments. And, don't forget,  if you want to practice your swordwork anytime, just come and say the word.
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready.1|Your next opponent will be a {s9}. You need to win {reg8} more fights in a row to advance to the next stage. Are you ready?
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_ready_to_fight|Yes I am.
dlga_novicemaster_ready_to_fight:close_window|Here you go then. Good luck.
dlga_novicemaster_are_you_ready:novicemaster_not_ready|Just a minute. I am not ready yet.
dlga_novicemaster_not_ready:close_window|Hey, You will never make it if you don't practice.
dlga_start:mayor_begin|Good day, my lord.
dlga_start:mayor_talk|Hello stranger, you seem to be new to {s9}. I am the administrator of this planet.
dlga_start:mayor_begin.1|Good day, {playername}.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed|{playername}, it was an incredible feat to get {s14} and {s15} make peace, and you made it happen. Your involvement has not only saved our planet from disaster, but it has also saved thousands of lives, and put an end to all the grief this bitter war has caused. As the citizens of {s19}, know that we'll be good on our word, and we are ready to pay the {reg12} credits we promised.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay|Thank you. Let me have the money.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_completed:lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay|No need for a payment. I only did what was right.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_pay:close_window|Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12} credits together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of this planet will not forget your help.
dlga_lord_persuade_lords_to_make_peace_no_pay:close_window|You are indeed an extraordinary person, {sir/madame}, and it is an honour for me to have known you. You not only did what was impossible and put an end to this terrible war, but you won't even accept a reward for it. Very well, I will not insist on the matter, but please know that you will have our eternal respect and gratitude.
dlga_mayor_begin:lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed|Very nice work, {playername}, you made short work of those lawless curs. Thank you kindly for all your help, and please accept this bounty of 150 credits.
dlga_lord_deal_with_night_bandits_completed:close_window|It was my pleasure, {s65}.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_looters_quest_response|Ah, {playername}. Have you any progress to report?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed|I've killed some looters.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods|I've brought you some goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_response:close_window|Not yet, sir. Farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 40 credits for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the looters have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now.   If there are any of them left, they've either run off or gone deep into hiding. That's good for business,   and what's good for business is good for the planet!   I think that concludes our arrangement, {playername}. Please accept this silver as a token of my gratitude. Thank you, and farewell.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Hah, I knew I could count on you! Just tell me which item to take from your baggage, and I'll send some men to collect it. I still need {reg1} credits' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_2|{s5}.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_response:mayor_looters_quest_goods_3|Nothing at the moment, sir.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_3:mayor_looters_quest_response|Anything else you need?
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:mayor_looters_quest_goods_response|Excellent, here is the money for your {s6}. Do you have any more goods to give me? I still need {reg1} credits' worth of goods.
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_goods_2:close_window|Well done, {playername}, that's the last of the goods I need. Here is the money for your {s6}, and a small bonus for helping me out. I'm afraid I won't be paying for any more goods, nor bounties on looters, but you're welcome to keep hunting the bastards if any remain. Thank you for your help, I won't forget it.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the nerfs successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} credits.
dlga_mayor_begin:move_cattle_herd_failed|I heard that you have lost the nerf herd on your way to {s9}. I had a very difficult time explaining your failure to the owner of that herd, {sir/madam}. Do you have anything to say?
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2|I am sorry. But I was attacked on the way.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed:move_cattle_herd_failed_2.1|I am sorry. The stupid animals wandered off during the night.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded to be compensated for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 credits. So you now owe me that money.
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|Dear {playername}. I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8} credits that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought them to their to his their knees.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} credits. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.
dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1} credits. I'd better collect that now.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.
dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_not_paid|I'm afraid I can't pay that sum now.
dlga_merchant_debts_not_paid:close_window|In that case, I am afraid, I can't deal with you. Guild rules... Come back when you can pay the {reg1} credits. And know that we'll be charging an interest to your debt. So the sooner you pay it, the better.
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_talk|What can I do for you?
dlga_mayor_friendly_pretalk:mayor_talk|Now... What else may I do for you?
dlga_mayor_pretalk:mayor_talk|Yes?
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_info_begin|Can you tell me about what you do?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_requested|Do you happen to have a job for me?
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_last_offered_job|About that job you offered me...
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...
dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|[Leave]
dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the guildmaster of {s9}. You can say I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some honest work.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this planet?
dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our planet's lord and protector is {s10}. He owns the main hall and sometimes resides there, and collects taxes from this planet. However we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the planet's guildmaster I have the authority to decide those things.
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_what_if_fail|What if I can't finish it?
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:merchant_quest_about_job_working|Well, I'm still working on it.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_working:mayor_pretalk|Good. I'm sure you will handle it.
dlga_merchant_quest_last_offered_job:merchant_quest_brief|Eh, you want to reconsider that. Good...
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk|I hope you don't fail. In that case, I'll have to ask for the price of the cargo you were carrying.
dlga_merchant_quest_what_if_fail:mayor_pretalk.1|Well, just do your best to finish it.
dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.
dlga_merchant_quest_stall:mayor_pretalk|Well, the job will be available for a few more days I guess. Tell me if you decide to take it.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief|Well, you look able enough. I think I might have something you could do.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try and make their fortune out of looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need somebody to teach those bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people. Kill or capture the bastards, I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40 credits on every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.1|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to deliver some {s4}. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine|I have a cargo of {s6} that needs to be delivered to the tavern in {s4}. If you can take {reg5} units of {s6} to {s4} in 7 days, you may earn {reg8} credits. What do you say?

dlga_merchant_quest_brief_deliver_wine:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I can't carry all that cargo now.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.2|You're looking for a job? Actually I was looking for someone to escort a caravan. Perhaps you can do that...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief|I am going to send a caravan of goods to {s8}. However with all those bandits and deserters on the roads, I don't want to send them out without an escort. If you can lead that caravan to {s8} in 15 days, you will earn {reg8} credits. Of course your party needs to be at least {reg4} strong to offer them any protection.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_taken|Alright. I will escort the caravan.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am afraid I don't have that many soldiers with me.
dlga_escort_merchant_caravan_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall.1|Sorry. I can't do that right now
dlga_start:close_window.21|We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Thanks.
dlga_start:close_window.22|Well, we have almost reached {s21}. We can cover the rest of the way ourselves. Here's your pay... {reg14} credits. Thanks for escorting us. Good luck.
dlga_start:merchant_caravan_intro_1|Greetings. You must be our escort, right?
dlga_merchant_caravan_intro_1:merchant_caravan_intro_2|Yes. My name is {playername}. I will lead you to {s1}.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.3|Actually, I was looking for an able adventurer like you. There's this group of particularly troublesome bandits. They have infested the vicinity of the planet and are preying on my caravans. They have avoided all the soldiers and the militias up to now. If someone doesn't stop them soon, I am going to be ruined...
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:troublesome_bandits_quest_brief|I will pay you {reg8} credits if you hunt down those troublesome bandits. It's dangerous work. But I believe that you are the {man/one} for it. What do you say?

dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:kidnapped_girl_quest_taken|Alright. I will take the ransom money to the bandits and bring back the girl.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_taken:close_window|Good. I knew we could trust you at this. Here is the ransom money, {reg12} credits. Count it before taking it. And please, don't attempt to do anything rash. Keep in mind that the girl's well being is more important than anything else...
dlga_kidnapped_girl_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|Sorry. I don't have time for this right now.

dlga_start:bandits_awaiting_ransom_intro_1|Are you the one that brought the ransom? Quick, give us the money now.
dlga_start:bandits_awaiting_ransom_intro_1.1|You came back? Quick, give us the money now.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_intro_1:bandits_awaiting_ransom_pay|Here, take the money. Just set the girl free.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_pay:close_window|Heh. You've brought the money all right. You can take the girl now. It was a pleasure doing business with you...
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_intro_1:bandits_awaiting_ransom_b|No way! You release the girl first.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b:bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2|You fool! Stop playing games and give us the money! 
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2:bandits_awaiting_ransom_pay|All right. Here's your money. Let the girl go now.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2:bandits_awaiting_ransom_no_money|I had left the money in a safe place. Let me go fetch it.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_no_money:close_window|Are you testing our patience or something?  Go and bring that money here quickly.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_b2:bandits_awaiting_ransom_fight|I have no intention to pay you anything. I demand that you release the girl now!
dlga_bandits_awaiting_ransom_fight:close_window|You won't be demanding anything when you're dead.
dlga_start:bandits_awaiting_remeet|What's it? You have given us the money. We have no more business.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_remeet:close_window|Sorry to bother you. I'll be on my way now.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_remeet:bandits_awaiting_remeet_2|We have one more business. You'll give the money back to me.
dlga_bandits_awaiting_remeet_2:close_window|Oh, that business! Of course. Let us get down to it.
dlga_start:kidnapped_girl_encounter_1|Oh {sir/madam}. Thank you so much for rescuing me. Will you take me to my family now?
dlga_kidnapped_girl_encounter_1:kidnapped_girl_join|Yes. Come with me. I'll take you home.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_join:close_window|Unfortunately. You do not have room in your party for me.
dlga_kidnapped_girl_join:close_window.1|Oh, thank you so much!

dlga_kidnapped_girl_wait:close_window|Oh, please {sir/madam}, do not leave me here all alone!
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_2:lost_kidnapped_girl|Unfortunately I lost the girl on the way here...
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl:lost_kidnapped_girl_2|Oh no! How am I going to tell this to my friend?
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_2:lost_kidnapped_girl_3|I'm sorry. I could do nothing about it.
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_3:lost_kidnapped_girl_4|You let me down {playername}. I had trusted you. I will let people know of your incompetence at this task. Also, I want back that {reg8} credits I gave you as the ransom fee.
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_4:merchant_quest_about_job_5a|Of course. Here you are...
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_5a:close_window|At least you have the decency to return the money.
dlga_lost_kidnapped_girl_4:merchant_quest_about_job_5b|Sorry. I don't have that amount with me.
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job_5b:close_window|Do you expect me to believe that? You are going to pay that ransom fee back! Go and bring the money now!
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1|This war between {s15} and {s14} has brought our planet to the verge of ruin. Our caravans get raided before they can reach their destination. Our merchants are afraid to leave the safety of the planet shields. And as if those aren't enough, the taxes to maintain the war take away the last bits of our savings. If peace does not come soon, we can not hold on for much longer.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_brief|You are right. But who can stop this madness called war?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_1:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject|It is your duty to help the nobles in their war effort. You shouldn't complain about it.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_reject:close_window|Hah. The nobles fight their wars for their greed and their dreams of glory. And it is poor honest folk like us who have to bear the real burden. But you obviously don't want to hear about that.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3|There have been attempts to reconcile the two sides and reach a settlement. However, there are powerful lords on both sides whose interests lie in continuing the war. These men urge all others not to heed to the word of sensible men, but to keep fighting. While these leaders remain influential, no peace settlement can be reached.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4|Who are these warmongers who block the way of peace?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_3:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4.1|Who are these lords you speak of?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_4:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5|They are {s12} from {s15} and {s13} from {s14}. Until they change their mind or lose their influence, there will be no chance of having peace between the two sides.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6|What can be done about this?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_5:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6.1|Alas, it seems nothing can be done about it.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_6:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7|There is a way to resolve the issue. A particularly determined person can perhaps persuade one or both of these lords to accept making peace. And even if that fails, it can be possible to see that these lords are defeated by force and taken prisoner. If they are captive, they will lose their influence and they can no longer oppose a settlement... What do you think? Can you do it?
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8|It seems difficult. But I will try.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.1|If the price is right, I may.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_7:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8.2|Forget it. This is not my problem.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_8:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9|Most of the merchants on the planet will gladly open up their purses to support such a plan. I think we can collect {reg12} credits between ourselves. We will be happy to reward you with that sum, if you can work this out. Convince {s12} and {s13} to accept a peace settlement, and if either of them proves too stubborn, make sure he falls captive and can not be ransomed until a peace deal is settled.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10|All right. I will do my best.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_9:merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no|Sorry. I can not do this.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_10:close_window|Excellent. You will have our blessings. I hope you can deal with those two old goats. We will be waiting and hoping for the good news.
dlga_merchant_quest_persuade_peace_no:close_window|Don't say no right away. Think about this for some time. If there is a {man/lady} who can manage to do this, it is you.
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_deal_with_night_bandits|Do I indeed! There's a group of bandits infesting the planet, and I'm at the end of my rope as to how to deal with them. They've been ambushing and robbing citizens under the cover of night, and then fading away quick as lightning when the guards finally show up. We've not been able to catch a one of them. They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these bandits alone and win. That seems to be the only way of bringing them to justice. Are you up to the task?

dlga_deal_with_night_bandits_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|That takes a weight off my shoulders, {playername}. You can expect a fine reward if you come back successful. Just don't get yourself killed, eh?
dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_brief.5|One of the merchants here is looking for a nerf herder to take his nerfs to the market at {s13}.
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:move_cattle_herd_quest_brief|The nerf herd must be at {s13} within 30 days. Sooner is better, much better, but it must be absolutely no later than 30 days. If you can do that, I'd be willing to pay you {reg8} credits for your trouble. Interested?
dlga_move_cattle_herd_quest_brief:move_cattle_herd_quest_taken|Aye, I can take the herd to {s13}.
dlga_move_cattle_herd_quest_brief:merchant_quest_stall|I am sorry, but no.

dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3|I think {reg5} packs of wheat will let us start the planting. Hopefully, we can find charitable people to help us with the rest.

dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I am afraid I don't have time for this. You'll need to find help elsewhere.

dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept|I can teach you how to defend yourself.

dlga_start:arena_master_fight_result|.
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk|Ha-ha, that's quite the bruise you're sporting. But don't worry; everybody gets trounced once in awhile. The important thing is to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and keep fighting. That's what champions do.
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.1|Hey, you managed to take down {reg8} opponents. Not bad. But that won't bring you any prize money. Now, if I were you, I would go back there and show everyone what I can do...
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.2|You put up quite a good fight there. Good moves. You definitely show promise. And you earned a prize of {reg10} credits for knocking down {reg8} opponents.
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.3|That was a good fight you put up there. You managed to take down no less than {reg8} opponents. And of course, you earned a prize money of {reg10} credits.
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.4|Your performance was amazing! You are without doubt a very skilled fighter. Not everyone can knock down {reg8} people in the fights. Of course you deserve a prize with that performance: {reg10} credits. Nice, eh?
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.5|That was damned good fighting, {playername}. You have very good moves, excellent tactics. And you earned a prize of {reg10} credits for knocking down {reg8} opponents.
dlga_arena_master_fight_result:arena_master_pre_talk.6|Congratulations champion! Your fight there was something to remember! You managed to be the last fighter standing beating down everyone else. And of course you won the grand prize of the fights: {reg10} credits.
dlga_start:arena_master_pre_talk|Hello {playername}. Good to see you again.
dlga_arena_master_pre_talk:arena_master_talk|What would you like to do?

dlga_arena_master_weapon_2_talk:arena_master_melee_talk|Great! We are always in need of fighters. Now, we have several types of fights. Most fighters prefer one of the classic ones, which use either vibroswords or blasters. But, we also have some that use either random weapons, holodroids, or lightsaber fighters if you want a challenge. Which one do you want to join?
dlga_arena_master_melee_talk:arena_master_melee_posttalk|The classic fight with vibroswords & energy shields.
dlga_arena_master_melee_talk:arena_master_melee_posttalk.1|The classic fight with blasters & vibroblades.

dlga_bandit_barter:close_window|Hey, I've heard of you! You slaughter us freebooters like dogs, and now you expect us to let you go for a few stinking coins? Forget it. You gave us no quarter, and you'll get none from us.
dlga_bandit_barter_3a:close_window|Heh, that wasn't so hard, was it? All right, we'll let you go now. Be off.

dlga_start:enemy_talk_1|You will not capture me again. Not this time.
dlga_enemy_talk_1:enemy_talk_2|You don't have a chance against me. Give up.
dlga_enemy_talk_2:close_window|I will give up when you are dead!
dlga_sell_prisoner_outlaws:sell_prisoner_outlaws|Hmmm. 10 credits for each looter makes {reg1} credits for all {reg0} of them.
dlga_sell_prisoner_outlaws:sell_prisoner_outlaws.1|Let me see. You've brought {reg0} bandits, so 20 credits for each comes up to {reg1} credits.
dlga_sell_prisoner_outlaws:sell_prisoner_outlaws.2|Well well, you've captured {reg0} brigands. Each one is worth 30 credits, so I'll give you {reg1} for them in total.
